Requirements:

 - Linux or POSIX.1-2001 compliant environment
 - GNU make, CMake 2.6.2 or newer
 - GCC and Boost headers (http://boost.org)
   OR GCC 4.x and its libstdc++ with header files
   OR a GCC compatible compiler and STL with C++-0x compliant smart pointers
 - zlib, libbz2 und their development components
 - (optional) libzma from XZ and its development components
 - (optional) recent FUSE library and its development files for the
   "virtual mirror" filesystem

Build and installation instructions:

 - run "make"
 - if an error occurs, read the message, solve the problem, run "make distclean"
   and retry with "make"
 - when done, copy build/apt-cacher-ng and build/in.acng to /usr/local/sbin
 - make apt-cacher-ng be executed at system startup time.
   debian/apt-cacher-ng.init might serve as inspiration.
 - for Avahi file installation, install contrib/apt-cacher-ng.service as needed

Configuration:

 - create a directory for cached files and for log files
 - set ownership and directory permissions in a way which allows 
   read/write/mkdir actions to the user account used to run apt-cacher-ng later
 - copy conf directory to /etc/apt-cacher-ng or similar location. 
 - adapt acng.conf and other *.conf files in that configuration directory. 
   See user manual (doc/apt-cacher-ng.pdf or doc/README) for instructions.
 - run apt-cacher-ng -c yourConfigurationDirectory
 - visit Command-and-Control web interface of apt-cacher-ng, link can be found
   among other instructions at http://yourHostName:portNumber/ , which might be
   http://localhost:3142/ with the default configuration
 - for apt clients, there is a config snipped in contrib/10-apt-cacher-ng.conf
   which might be installed into /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/.
