<h1><a name="bugs"></a>Chapter 10: Known Bugs and Limitations</h1>
<ul><li>
Versions between 0.2.6 and 0.3.3 created broken X-Original-Source URLs in the .head files. The effects should be negligible.
</li>
<li>
Only the "Basic" type of HTTP proxy authentication is supported at the moment
</li>
<li>
Only HTTP HEAD and GET commands are supported properly. POST support is limited to the calls made by apt-listbugs and might garble some requests.
</li>
<li>
Transparent proxy mode not implemented yet
</li>
<li>
Arbitrary TCP ports on remote side and HTTPS usage only possible with remapping configuration
</li>
<li>
See TODO file in apt-cacher-ng source for various other notes
</li>
<li>
The index update in expiration task works best if the original URLs are stored in the cache. As fallback solution, it attempts to guess the source URL by evaluating file's location in the cache which should work in most cases but in some cases might fail. In case of failure, a real user should download failing files once through the proxy.
</li>
</ul>
